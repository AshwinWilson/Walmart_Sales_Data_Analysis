ðŸ”„ Workflow Summary
1. Data Acquisition
Pulled dataset using Kaggle API

Stored raw data locally for transformation

2. Data Cleaning (Python)
Removed duplicates and handled missing values

Converted data types (dates, prices)

Formatted currency and numerical fields

3. Feature Engineering
Added Total_Amount = Quantity Ã— Unit_Price to streamline analysis

4. Load into SQL
Loaded cleaned data into MySQL and PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy

Verified accuracy using test queries

5. SQL Business Analysis
Wrote SQL queries to address key business questions:

ðŸ“ˆ Sales trends across branches and categories

### 1. Total Revenue by Branch
This query calculates the total revenue generated by each Walmart branch.

```sql
SELECT Branch,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM walmart
GROUP BY Branch
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
### 2. Monthly Sales Trend by Category
Analyzes how different product categories perform over time on a monthly basis.

```sql
SELECT 
    strftime('%Y-%m', date) AS month,
    category,
    ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY month, category
ORDER BY month, total_sales DESC;
```
### 3. Revenue by Payment Method
Measures how much revenue is generated through different payment options.
```sql
SELECT payment_method,
       COUNT(*) AS total_transactions,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY payment_method
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
### 4. Average Transaction Value per Branch
```sql
SELECT Branch,
       ROUND(AVG(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS avg_transaction_value
FROM walmart
GROUP BY Branch
ORDER BY avg_transaction_value DESC;
```
### 5. Estimated Profit by Category
Uses the profit margin to estimate the profitability of each category.
```sql
SELECT category,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity * profit_margin), 2) AS estimated_profit
FROM walmart
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY estimated_profit DESC;
```
### 6. Peak Hours by Quantity Sold
```sql
SELECT strftime('%H', time) AS hour,
       SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM walmart
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;
```
### 7. Top-Selling Cities
```sql
SELECT City,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
### 8. High-Rated Categories
```sql
SELECT category,
       ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM walmart
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```
ðŸ“Š Sample Insights
Replace with actual results from your analysis.

Branch B had the highest revenue contribution.

Health & Beauty was the top-performing category.

Evenings (6 PM â€“ 9 PM) were the peak shopping hours.

E-wallets were the most preferred payment method.



ðŸ“ˆ Outcome
This project demonstrates a full cycle of data analysis, from raw data handling to SQL-based business intelligence. It's designed to reflect the tasks a data analyst would perform in a real-world business environment.
