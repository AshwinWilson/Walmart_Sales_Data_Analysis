🚀 Project Workflow: Walmart Sales Data Analysis
This end-to-end data analytics project focuses on uncovering key business insights from Walmart sales data using Python, Pandas, SQLite (optionally MySQL/PostgreSQL), and SQL. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the process.

1. 📁 Project Environment Setup
Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python 3.8+, SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL

Goal: Set up a clean and structured workspace for smooth development and collaboration.

<pre> project/ │-- data/ # Raw and processed datasets │-- notebooks/ # Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and analysis │-- sql_queries/ # All SQL scripts used in the project │-- README.md # Project documentation │-- requirements.txt # Required Python libraries </pre>
2. 🔑 Kaggle API Setup (Optional)
This step is required only if downloading the dataset directly from Kaggle.

Download your kaggle.json API key from your Kaggle account (Account Settings → API).

Save it in your system's .kaggle/ folder.

Use this command to download the dataset:

bash
Copy
Edit
kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>
3. 📥 Dataset Acquisition
Source: Walmart Sales Dataset on Kaggle

Store the dataset in the data/ folder for consistent access.

4. 📦 Install Required Libraries
Install all Python packages needed to run the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy sqlite3
For optional MySQL or PostgreSQL integration:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install mysql-connector-python psycopg2
5. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Start with basic inspection to understand the data:

python
Copy
Edit
df.info()
df.describe()
df.head()
Check for anomalies, null values, and data types.

6. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Remove duplicates

Handle missing values

Convert date and time columns to datetime

Clean currency fields and convert to float:

python
Copy
Edit
df['unit_price'] = df['unit_price'].replace(r'[\$,]', '', regex=True).astype(float)
7. 🏗️ Feature Engineering
Create a total_amount column for revenue analysis:

python
Copy
Edit
df['total_amount'] = df['unit_price'] * df['quantity']
This column is used in multiple SQL queries for financial metrics.

8. 🗃️ Load Cleaned Data into SQLite
python
Copy
Edit
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("walmart_sales.db")
df.to_sql("walmart", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
You can also use SQLAlchemy for loading into MySQL/PostgreSQL.

9. 📊 SQL-Based Business Analysis
Run complex SQL queries to derive insights like:

💰 Total revenue by branch, city, and category

📈 Monthly sales trends

🛒 Top-selling products and best-selling payment methods

⏰ Peak shopping hours and customer behavior

📉 Profit margin analysis by category and branch

SQL scripts can be found in:
📂 sql_queries/analysis.sql

10. 📝 Documentation & GitHub Publishing
All notebooks and scripts are documented and version-controlled.

Deliverables include:

README.md

Cleaned dataset (or instructions to obtain it)

Python and SQL scripts

Analysis notebooks (/notebooks folder)
📈 Sales trends across branches and categories

### 1. Total Revenue by Branch
This query calculates the total revenue generated by each Walmart branch.

```sql
SELECT Branch,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM walmart
GROUP BY Branch
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
### 2. Monthly Sales Trend by Category
Analyzes how different product categories perform over time on a monthly basis.

```sql
SELECT 
    strftime('%Y-%m', date) AS month,
    category,
    ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY month, category
ORDER BY month, total_sales DESC;
```
### 3. Revenue by Payment Method
Measures how much revenue is generated through different payment options.
```sql
SELECT payment_method,
       COUNT(*) AS total_transactions,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY payment_method
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
### 4. Average Transaction Value per Branch
```sql
SELECT Branch,
       ROUND(AVG(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS avg_transaction_value
FROM walmart
GROUP BY Branch
ORDER BY avg_transaction_value DESC;
```
### 5. Estimated Profit by Category
Uses the profit margin to estimate the profitability of each category.
```sql
SELECT category,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity * profit_margin), 2) AS estimated_profit
FROM walmart
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY estimated_profit DESC;
```
### 6. Peak Hours by Quantity Sold
```sql
SELECT strftime('%H', time) AS hour,
       SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM walmart
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;
```
### 7. Top-Selling Cities
```sql
SELECT City,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
### 8. High-Rated Categories
```sql
SELECT category,
       ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM walmart
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```
📊 Sample Insights
Replace with actual results from your analysis.

Branch B had the highest revenue contribution.

Health & Beauty was the top-performing category.

Evenings (6 PM – 9 PM) were the peak shopping hours.

E-wallets were the most preferred payment method.



📈 Outcome
This project demonstrates a full cycle of data analysis, from raw data handling to SQL-based business intelligence. It's designed to reflect the tasks a data analyst would perform in a real-world business environment.
