## üîß 1. Project Environment Setup

**Tools Used:**  
Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python 3.8+, SQLite (or optional MySQL/PostgreSQL)

**Goal:**  
Set up a clean and structured workspace for smooth development and collaboration.

<pre>

‚îÇ-- data/           # Raw and processed datasets
‚îÇ-- notebooks/      # Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and analysis
‚îÇ-- sql_queries/    # All SQL scripts used in the project
‚îÇ-- README.md       # Project documentation
‚îÇ-- requirements.txt# Required Python libraries
</pre>

## üì• 2. Dataset Acquisition

- **Data Source:** [Walmart Sales Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Storage:** Save the dataset in the `data/` folder for easy access and versioning.

---

## üì¶ 3. Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy sqlite3
```

For optional MySQL or PostgreSQL support:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python psycopg2
```

---

## üîç 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand the dataset's structure and initial quality:

```python
df.info()
df.describe()
df.head()
```

---

## üßπ 5. Data Cleaning

- **Remove Duplicates:** Eliminated duplicate rows to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Handle Missing Values:** Dropped or imputed missing values based on significance.
- **Fix Data Types:** Converted fields like `date` to `datetime`, and `unit_price` to `float`.
- **Currency Formatting:** Removed `$` signs using regex:
  ```python
  df['unit_price'] = df['unit_price'].replace(r'[\$,]', '', regex=True).astype(float)
  ```
- **Validation:** Confirmed data consistency and fixed formatting issues.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6. Feature Engineering

Created a `total_amount` column for easier revenue and profit analysis:

```python
df['total_amount'] = df['unit_price'] * df['quantity']
```

---

## üóÉÔ∏è 7. Load Cleaned Data into SQLite

```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("walmart_sales.db")
df.to_sql("walmart", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
```

---

## üìä 8. SQL-Based Business Analysis

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Revenue by Branch
```sql
SELECT Branch, ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM walmart
GROUP BY Branch
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Monthly Sales Trend by Category
```sql
SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', date) AS month, category,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY month, category
ORDER BY month, total_sales DESC;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue by Payment Method
```sql
SELECT payment_method, COUNT(*) AS total_transactions,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY payment_method
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Average Transaction Value per Branch
```sql
SELECT Branch, ROUND(AVG(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS avg_transaction_value
FROM walmart
GROUP BY Branch
ORDER BY avg_transaction_value DESC;
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Estimated Profit by Category
```sql
SELECT category,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity * profit_margin), 2) AS estimated_profit
FROM walmart
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY estimated_profit DESC;
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Peak Hours by Quantity Sold
```sql
SELECT strftime('%H', time) AS hour,
       SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM walmart
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Top-Selling Cities
```sql
SELECT City,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ High-Rated Categories
```sql
SELECT category,
       ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM walmart
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```
