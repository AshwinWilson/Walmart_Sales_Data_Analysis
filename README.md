Walmart Sales Data Analysis
This end-to-end data analytics project focuses on uncovering key business insights from Walmart sales data using Python, Pandas, SQLite and SQL. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the process.

1. üìÅ Project Environment Setup
Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python 3.8+, SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL

Goal: Set up a clean and structured workspace for smooth development and collaboration.

<pre> project/ ‚îÇ-- data/ # Raw and processed datasets ‚îÇ-- notebooks/ # Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and analysis ‚îÇ-- sql_queries/ # All SQL scripts used in the project ‚îÇ-- README.md # Project documentation ‚îÇ-- requirements.txt # Required Python libraries </pre>

2. üì• Dataset Acquisition
Data Source: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
Dataset Link: Walmart Sales Dataset
Store the dataset in the data/ folder for consistent access.

3. üì¶ Install Required Libraries
Install all Python packages needed to run the project:

```python
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy sqlite3
```
For optional MySQL or PostgreSQL integration:
```python
pip install mysql-connector-python psycopg2
```

4. üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Start with basic inspection to understand the data:

```python
df.info()
df.describe()
df.head()
```
Check for anomalies, null values, and data types.

5. üßπ Data Cleaning

‚Ä¢	Remove Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate entries to prevent skewed analysis results.

‚Ä¢	Handle Missing Values: Dropped rows or columns with insignificant missing values. Filled in values where necessary to preserve data integrity.

‚Ä¢	Fix Data Types: Converted columns to appropriate data types (e.g., date as datetime, unit_price as float).

‚Ä¢	Currency Formatting: Removed currency symbols (e.g., $) from unit_price using .replace() and converted values to numerical format.

‚Ä¢	Validation: Verified the final dataset for consistency, formatting errors, and data type mismatches.

6. üèóÔ∏è Feature Engineering
Create a total_amount column for revenue analysis:

```python
df['total_amount'] = df['unit_price'] * df['quantity']
```
This column is used in multiple SQL queries for financial metrics.

7. üóÉÔ∏è Load Cleaned Data into SQLite
   
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("walmart_sales.db")
df.to_sql("walmart", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
```
You can also use SQLAlchemy for loading into MySQL/PostgreSQL.

8. üìä SQL-Based Business Analysis
SQL queries to derive insights like:

### 1. Total Revenue by Branch
This query calculates the total revenue generated by each Walmart branch.

```sql
SELECT Branch,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM walmart
GROUP BY Branch
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
### 2. Monthly Sales Trend by Category
Analyzes how different product categories perform over time on a monthly basis.

```sql
SELECT 
    strftime('%Y-%m', date) AS month,
    category,
    ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY month, category
ORDER BY month, total_sales DESC;
```
### 3. Revenue by Payment Method
Measures how much revenue is generated through different payment options.
```sql
SELECT payment_method,
       COUNT(*) AS total_transactions,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY payment_method
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
### 4. Average Transaction Value per Branch
```sql
SELECT Branch,
       ROUND(AVG(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS avg_transaction_value
FROM walmart
GROUP BY Branch
ORDER BY avg_transaction_value DESC;
```
### 5. Estimated Profit by Category
Uses the profit margin to estimate the profitability of each category.
```sql
SELECT category,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity * profit_margin), 2) AS estimated_profit
FROM walmart
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY estimated_profit DESC;
```
### 6. Peak Hours by Quantity Sold
```sql
SELECT strftime('%H', time) AS hour,
       SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM walmart
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;
```
### 7. Top-Selling Cities
```sql
SELECT City,
       ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 2) AS total_sales
FROM walmart
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
### 8. High-Rated Categories
```sql
SELECT category,
       ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM walmart
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```

9. üìä Results and Insights
üîπ Sales Insights
Identified top-performing product categories by total revenue.

Analyzed branches with the highest overall sales, helping to highlight regional performance.

Evaluated preferred payment methods, aiding decisions for payment gateway prioritization.

üîπ Profitability
Calculated estimated profit margins by product category and location.

Uncovered the most profitable store branches, supporting targeted investments.

üîπ Customer Behavior
Explored customer ratings to understand satisfaction trends.

Analyzed payment preferences across branches and customer segments.

Identified peak shopping hours and high-traffic dates for staffing and inventory planning.

10. üöÄ Future Enhancements
Dashboard Integration: Connect with Power BI or Tableau for interactive data visualizations and real-time insights.

Data Enrichment: Combine with additional datasets (e.g., customer demographics, marketing campaigns) to deepen the analysis.

Automated Data Pipeline: Build a fully automated ETL workflow for real-time data ingestion, processing, and analysis.



üìà Outcome
This project demonstrates a full cycle of data analysis, from raw data handling to SQL-based business intelligence. It's designed to reflect the tasks a data analyst would perform in a real-world business environment.
